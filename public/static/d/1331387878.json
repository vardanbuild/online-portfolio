I believe in delivering solutions in a timely, extensible, maintainable, readable and most importantly reliable manner, for which I have extensive experience working in testing frameworks like Cypress, Jest and JUnit.\n\nI prefer working on projects that make a direct impact to the end user. Solving real-world problems that people face today in IT industry intrigues me the most.
